When you would like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
    For me it has to do with efficiently and stichlessly working across all the 
    machines I have. By way of commit, push and pull all are in sink...


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    I am in control what I want to have locally. moreover nothing should break my system
    without my knowledge.
