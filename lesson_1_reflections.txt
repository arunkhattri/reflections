How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

magical, it was great to find the diff in a puff.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

can restore any previous version if i am not liking current one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

it's good as to avoid unnecessary saved version. This way I know which can be called a
version in true sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

may be later

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log helps in viewing all commits and if one wants to compare two commits git diff
helps in that.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know i can revert back to earlier point.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    It may help saving my python codes across the machines.
