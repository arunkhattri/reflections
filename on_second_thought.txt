On second thought...
---------------------

How the hash value is being calculated for its content ?

How checksumming (SHA-1 hash) in git helps ?
    before storing any file git checksummed it and refer it by that checksum.
    this way nothing happens without git knowing it. can't lose information in
    transit or file get corrupt without git knowing it.
