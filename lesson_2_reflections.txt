What happens when you initialize a repoositry? Why do you need to do it?

    A .git folder is created inside the directory. Ah! you need something to be done to 
    get it worked with git and initialization can be the best option...

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
    
    Staging area is where you are putting things to be committed. What is to be committed
    is in your staging area not in working directory.
